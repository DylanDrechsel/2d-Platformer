Bugs to fix:

Roll oMushroom interactions
	--> Roll from platform to top of oMushroom should make the player jump
	--> State issue when oPlayer rolls through an enemy
	
Other Issues:
	--> When oFirerain hits oPlayer while rolling I get a state error
	--> When oPlayer rolls over a gap the gravity kicks in and pushes them below the ground
